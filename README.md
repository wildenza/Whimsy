Whimsy Viewer is a simple app about camping made for the GDSC Club from Timisoara more of a proof of concept, Its primary aim is to provide essential information on camping sites and eco-friendly trails. 
With this app, users can access details about different camping locations and eco-tracks conveniently.
It has been created in React Native & Expo Go whilst participating at the GDSC Club.

For some reason the .fbx/gltf/obj files take a long time to load,even if they have less than 2000 polygons.The ones with ~800 are in the 'safe-area'.
The whole scene is a canvas itself, with a three axis world-space.
And for resource saving purposes I have used a single material texture atlas which has around 1024x1024 tex-res.
Also all of the files use the same atlas.


The Api used : NPS Gov Database, which has a generous number of Parks & Trails from the US
